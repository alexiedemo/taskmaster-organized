# TaskFlow AI - Intelligent Task Management PRD

## Core Purpose & Success
- **Mission Statement**: An AI-powered task management app that learns from user behavior to provide intelligent recommendations, optimize productivity, and suggest better ways to organize and complete tasks.
- **Success Indicators**: 
  - Users complete 30% more tasks using AI suggestions
  - Task completion patterns improve over time

## Project Classification & Approach
- **Complexity Level**: Complex Application (AI integration, advanced state management, behavioral analytics)
- **Primary User Activity**: Creating and Interacting with AI-enhanced task management

## Thought Process for Feature Selection
- **Core Problem Analysis**: Traditional todo apps are passive - they don't learn or adapt to help users be more productive
- **User Context**: Users want guidance on what to work on, when to work on it, and how to organize their tasks more effectively
- **Critical Path**: Add task → Get AI insights → Complete tasks more efficiently → Learn from patterns
- **Key Moments**: 
  1. AI suggests optimal task prioritization
  2. Smart recommendations for task categorization
  3. Predictive insights about completion patterns
